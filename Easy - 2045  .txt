I saw somewhere that by 2045, 
AI will overtake the world and no human will be better than an AI at any job, 
what do you think ?
See, being a Geek I ignored the statement and found something pretty interesting :
2045's representation in binary has only one zero! 
2015 -> '11111111101'
Your task is to count all the years within a given interval that share this peculiar property: 
having just one zero in their binary representation.

Input:

The input consists of a single line containing two integers 'x' and 'y' (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^14) — 
representing the first year and the last year of the interval.

Output:

Print a single integer — the number of years within the chosen interval that have only one zero 
in their binary representation.
