Bachka and Ashref are engaged in an intriguing card game. On the table, there are 'n' stack of cards, each stack containing positive integers on the cards.

The game unfolds with Bachka taking the first turn, followed by Ashref. In each turn, Bachka selects a card from the top of any non-empty stack, 
while Ashref takes a card from the bottom of any non-empty stack. The goal for both players is to maximize the total sum of the cards they acquire during the game. 
The game continues until all the piles become empty.

Assuming Bachka and Ashref play smart and optimally, your task is to determine the final score of the game.

Input:

The first line contains an integer 'n' (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — representing the number of card piles on the table.

Each of the following 'n' lines provides a description of a pile: the first integer 's_i' is the number of cards in the 'i-th' pile (1 ≤ s_i ≤ 100), 
followed by 's_i' positive integers 'c_1, c_2, ..., c_k, ..., c_si' (1 ≤ c_k ≤ 1000) — representing the sequence of numbers on the cards from the top of the pile to the bottom.

Output:

Print two integers: the sum of Bachka's cards and the sum of Ashref's cards if they both play optimally.
