Algebra! Remember algebra? There is a theory that as engineers progresses further and further in
their studies, they lose basic math skills. This problem is designed to help you remember those basic
algebra skills, make the world a better place, etc., etc.

Input:
Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of lines will represent one
problem. The first line will contain a list of integers {c0, c1, . . . , cn} which represent a set of coefficients
to a polynomial expression. The order of the polynomial is n. The coefficients should be paired with
the terms of the polynomial in the following manner:
c0xn + c1xn−1 + · · · + cnx0   
The second line of text represents a sequence of values for x, {x0, x1, . . . , xm}.

Output:
For each pair of lines, your program should evaluate the polynomial for all the values of x (x0 through
xm) and output the resulting values on a single line.

Input:
-2
5 0 1 6
1 -1
7 6 -1
 
Output:
-2 -2 -2 -2
6 5 -2
