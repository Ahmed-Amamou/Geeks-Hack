Problem Statement:
Levi is facing off against a group of Titans. Each Titan has its health denoted by H_i.

In this battle, Levi has two combat options:

Attack: Levi selects a Titan, decreasing its health by 1.
Special Move: Levi selects a Titan, instantly reducing its health to 0.
Levi's triumph comes when all the Titans' healths reach 0 or below.

Calculate the minimum number of times Levi needs to use regular attacks (excluding Special Moves) 
to secure victory when he can utilize the Special Move at most K times.

Input :
The first line of input will have N(1<=N<=10000),K(0<K<10000) the number of titans
The second line will represent the healths of each titan. H_1,H_2,…,H_n (1≤H_i≤10^10)


Output:
Display the minimum number of times Levi must perform regular attacks (excluding Special Moves) before achieving victory.

input1:
3 1
4 1 5
output1:
5

input2:
7 8
7 2 3 2 5 8 4 1
