Imagine you're playing Candy Crush for the first time, and you've just completed the levels in the first candy box. 
Each level is characterized by two integers: 
ai — the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level with one star, 
bi — the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level with two stars (ai < bi).

To unlock the next candy box as quickly as possible, you aim to earn at least 'z' stars. 
Your goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve this. 
Note that each level can only be completed once, either with one star or two stars. 
You do not necessarily need to complete all the levels.

Input:

The first line contains two integers 'n' and 'z' (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000 ; 1 ≤ z ≤ 2n) — 
representing the number of levels in the first candy box and the number of stars you need to unlock the next candy box.

Each of the following 'n' lines contains two integers 'ai' and 'bi' (1 ≤ ai < bi ≤ 10^9) — the attributes of the 'i-th' level.

Output:

Print a single integer 't' — the minimum number of moves required to unlock the next candy box as quickly as possible.

Examples:

Note:

In the second example, you can achieve 3 stars by completing levels 2 and 4 with 2 stars, requiring a total of 14 moves.
