Aycha has a group of painters specialized in house painting.
She responded to a call for tenders to paint numerous rental houses and hotels belonging to a major businessman in the Maldives.

In order not to lose too much time, the group asked you as a specialist to help them predict whether they would be able to finish all the houses before the deadline, by giving them the minimum time needed to paint each house.
