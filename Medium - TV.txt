Given a string s containing only characters 't' and 'v', 
perform the following operations any number of times in any order:

Replace any occurrence of 'tt' as a substring with 'v'.
Replace any occurrence of 'vv' as a substring with 't'.
Determine the number of possible strings that can be obtained by executing these operations on s. Find the count modulo 1000000007.

Input:
the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5)
Output:
the number of strings 's' that can be obtained, modulo 1000000007.


Input1:
tttt
Output1:
6

Input2:
tvtvtvtv
Output2:
1


note: In example 1, only 6 strings can be obtained:
- tttt
- ttv
- tvt
- vtt
- vv
- t
In example 2, we can't perform any operation.
