Ceaser Cipher problem !

In the grand world of One Piece, where pirates chase dreams and treasures, 
Luffy comes across a mysterious encoded message that hints at the legendary One Piece treasure's location.
This message is encrypted using a code known only to the boldest of pirates.

Here's how the cipher works: Each letter in the original message is shifted 
a specific number of positions forward in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. 
Can you solve this Luffy? said the ***

Your mission is to write a program that, depending on the input, 
can either decode the message or encode it further using this enigmatic cipher.
As Luffy's trusted ally, you are the one who can assist him in cracking this code.

Input:

The first line contains an integer "N" (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), indicating the number of operations.
The following "N" lines each contain an operation in the form of a single character 
('E' for encoding or 'D' for decoding) followed by a space and a message to be encoded or decoded. 
The message consists of lowercase English letters only and has a length between 1 and 100.
Output:

For each decoding operation ('D'), output the decoded message.
For each encoding operation ('E'), output the encoded message.

Example:

Input:
3
E fnqjwx
D lqwuhw
E mvzv

output:

iqnqza
orange
ryzb
