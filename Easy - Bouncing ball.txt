You are given a rectangular box with dimensions: length l and height h. Inside this box, there is a ball initially located at coordinates (x, y), and it is launched with an initial velocity vector (vx, vy).

The ball obeys the laws of physics and bounces off the walls of the box according to the following rules:

When the ball hits a vertical wall of the box, it reflects its horizontal velocity, i.e., it reverses its vx component.
When the ball hits a horizontal wall of the box, it reflects its vertical velocity, i.e., it reverses its vy component.
You are also given a positive integer K, representing the number of times the ball will bounce off the walls. Your task is to determine the final position of the ball after K bounces.

Write a function or program that takes the following inputs:

l: The length of the box.
h: The height of the box.
(x, y): The initial coordinates of the ball.
(vx, vy): The initial velocity vector of the ball.
K: The number of bounces.
Your function or program should return the final coordinates (x_final, y_final) of the ball after K bounces.

Input:

The input consists of five integers: l, h, x, y, K (1 ≤ l, h, x, y, K ≤ 1000).
The input is such that the ball always starts inside the box.
Output:

Output the final coordinates (x_final, y_final) of the ball after K bounces, each separated by a space.
