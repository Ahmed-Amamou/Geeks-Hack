Chakckouka Problem ! 
Ahmed is a fan of a traditional dish called "Chakchouka," and he has a peculiar way of identifying it in a string. 
According to his definition, a string is considered delicious if it starts with "chak" and ends with "chouka".
Moreover, two substrings are deemed distinct if they are situated at different positions within the text.

Given a string 's', your task is to count and print the number of delicious substrings in the given string.

delicious substrings.
