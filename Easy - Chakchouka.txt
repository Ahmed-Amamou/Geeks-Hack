Chakckouka Problem ! 
Ahmed is a fan of a traditional dish called "Chakchouka," and he has a peculiar way of identifying it in a string. 
According to his definition, a string is considered delicious if it starts with "chak" and ends with "chouka".
Additionally, two substrings are considered different if they appear at different positions in the text.

Given a string 's,' your task is to count and print the number of delicious substrings in the given string.

Input:

The input consists of a single string 's' (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) — the string in which you need to find 
delicious substrings.
Output:

Print exactly one integer — the number of delicious substrings in the given string.
