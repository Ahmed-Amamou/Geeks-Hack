Mahmud is playing Rummy with a hand of 14 cards. 
Each card can be a value from A to K and belongs to one of the four suits: 
S (Spades), D (Diamonds), C (Clubs), H (Hearts). 
To score(tamna3) in this game, Hamoud needs to form sets from these cards. Sets can either be :
- three or four cards of the same value but with different suits (known as 3 or 4 of a kind)
or
-'straight'; which requires at least three cards of the same suit in sequence (e.g., C2 C3 C4).

Your task is to determine if it's possible to achieve a score >= 72, using these card combinations. 
If it is possible, provide a "YES" along with the highest achievable score "M". Otherwise, simply print "NO".

Input:
A list of space-separated strings representing the 15 cards in Mahmud's hand.

Output:
"YES M" if it's possible to reach a score higher than 72, where "M" represents the highest possible score achievable. 
If not possible, print "NO".

Notes : 
- You can't use a card twice in two different sets
- A counts as 10 if used in a set like (SJ,SQ,SK,SA) 
- A counts as 1 if used in a set like (SA,S2,S3,S4)
