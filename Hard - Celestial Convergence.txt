Problem Statement:
In a celestial multiverse, two distinct worlds are on the brink of collision, causing spatial chaos. 
You are tasked with a profound challenge: calculating the overlap volume where the two worlds intersect, 
resembling the intersection of '2 spheres' in our dimensional understanding.

Input:
The initial line provides coordinates indicating the essence of the first world in the multiverse. 
World coordinates comprise the center's multidimensional coordinates and its radius, presented as C((x, y, z), R).
The second line unveils the coordinates of the second celestial world.

Output:
The output must reveal the volumetric space shared by the intersecting worlds, reflecting the collision volume.

Examples:
Input:
50 0 0 60
-20 0 0 40
Output:
59578.061

Note:
The output should be accurate to three decimal places
